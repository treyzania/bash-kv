# Bash KV

This is a simple key-value store in Bash that stores data in plaintext files.

What did you expect?

## Requirements

* bash

* grep

* sed

You probably already have these on your system.  If you don't then I have no 
idea what's wrong with you.

## Limitations

* Your imagination

* Newlines and stuff like that.

## Why?

Because I thought it would be funny.
